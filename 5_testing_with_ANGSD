# Angsd 

First make a fastafile from the XM seq like this from within `/net/infofile4-inside/volume1/scratch/ben/2017_XL_XG_RADseq/samples/concat/angsd0.916/angsd`:

`./angsd -i ../../XM_1_sorted.bam -doFasta 1 -doCounts 1 -out XM_1_sorted.bam.fa`

Turns out that the commands for reading a fasta file as an outgroup are not yet implemented.  Instead I typed this command:

`./angsd -doAbbababa2 1 -bam bam.filelist -doCounts 1 -out bam.Angsd -minQ 20 -minMapQ 30 -p 1`

The bam.filelist lists the XM file last, so hopefully that will be the outgroup.

That didn't seem to work so I tried this:

`./angsd -doAbbababa 1 -bam bam.filelist -doCounts 1 -out bam.Angsd -useLast 1`
